# KDE Plasma Digital Clock (Same Size, Right Aligned)
## `kde-plasma-digital-clock-ssra`

Fork of [KDE Plasma Digital Clock](https://invent.kde.org/plasma/plasma-workspace/-/tree/master/applets/digital-clock). Modified based on [alex47's "Same Size Digital Clock"](https://github.com/alex47/PlasmaDigitalClockSameSize) and [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/cachyos/comments/1lj776m/orgkdeplasmadigitalclock_but_right_aligned/)

The same as the stock digital clock, except the time and date fonts are the same size, and everything is right-aligned. Overall, similar to the Windows 10/11 digital clock.
